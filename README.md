### Hello there ðŸ‘‹,
I am a first-generation Vietnamese American new graduate from the University of Washington. During my time at UW I majored in computer science and completed my Bachelors of Science. I like to spend my leisure time coding and playing video games. As I add more projects over time and strive to improve as a programmer, I hope to continue learning new things and developing personally here.
